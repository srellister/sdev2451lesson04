# DRF Aggregations, Live Search, and Data Visualization with Recharts

This example extends the connected fleet application from the previous example. We already have a working full-stack app where the React frontend fetches real data from the Django REST Framework backend. Here we go further: the stats endpoint returns richer aggregated data, the vehicle and driver lists gain live search, and a new chart visualises average trip distances per week using Recharts.

## Prerequisites

### Backend
- Create a virtual environment inside `vehiclefleet_backend/` and install packages from `requirements.txt`.
- Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations.
- Run `python manage.py loaddata vehicles drivers trips` to load the base sample data.
- Run `python manage.py runserver`.

### Frontend
- Run `npm install` inside `vehiclefleet_frontend/`.
- Run `npm run dev`.

---

## Steps

We have already built a full-stack Fleet Management app where the React frontend fetches live data from the Django REST Framework API. In this example we add backend aggregations using Django's ORM, live search filtering wired through React Query, and a Recharts bar chart to visualise the weekly distance data.

---

### 1. Enhance the stats endpoint in `vehiclefleet_backend/fleet/views.py`

The existing stats endpoint only returns counts. We want it to also return the overall average trip distance and a breakdown of average distance per week for the last six months — data we will visualise in a chart.

```python
# fleet/views.py

from datetime import timedelta

from django.db.models import Avg, Count
from django.db.models.functions import TruncWeek
from django.utils import timezone
# ... other imports ...

class FleetStatsView(APIView):

    def get(self, request):
        avg = Trip.objects.aggregate(avg_distance=Avg("distance"))["avg_distance"]

        six_months_ago = timezone.now() - timedelta(weeks=26)
        weekly_avg_distance = list(
            Trip.objects
            .filter(start_time__gte=six_months_ago, distance__isnull=False)
            .annotate(week=TruncWeek("start_time"))
            .values("week")
            .annotate(avg_distance=Avg("distance"))
            .order_by("week")
            .values_list("week", "avg_distance")
        )

        return Response({
            "total_vehicles": Vehicle.objects.count(),
            "total_drivers": Driver.objects.count(),
            "total_trips": Trip.objects.count(),
            "avg_trip_distance": round(avg, 2) if avg is not None else None,
            "avg_distance_per_week": [
                {
                    "week": week.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
                    "avg_distance": round(float(avg_dist), 2),
                }
                for week, avg_dist in weekly_avg_distance
            ],
        })
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `Avg("distance")` computes a single database-level average across all completed trips. Trips where `distance` is `null` (in-progress) are excluded from the average automatically by the database.
- `timezone.now() - timedelta(weeks=26)` defines a rolling six-month window. Using `timezone.now()` rather than `datetime.now()` respects Django's `USE_TZ = True` setting, which keeps all datetimes timezone-aware.
- `TruncWeek("start_time")` truncates each trip's timestamp to the Monday of its week, producing a consistent `GROUP BY` key.
- `.values("week").annotate(avg_distance=Avg(...))` is Django's group-by pattern: `values()` sets the grouping column and the second `annotate()` applies the aggregate within each group.
- `distance__isnull=False` in the filter ensures in-progress trips are excluded from the weekly breakdown as well.
- `week.strftime("%Y-%m-%d")` serialises each Monday as an ISO date string so JSON can represent it cleanly.

---

### 2. Load variety fixture data into `fleet/fixtures/trips_variety.json`

The base fixture only has five trips. We need a richer dataset spread over six months with a variety of distances to make the stats endpoint — especially the weekly chart — meaningful.

The project includes a `trips_variety.json` fixture with 12 additional trips (PKs 6–17) spanning January to June 2026, with distances ranging from 6 km to 194 km. Load it after the base fixtures:

```bash
python manage.py loaddata trips_variety
```

Expected output:
```
Installed 12 object(s) from 1 fixture(s).
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `loaddata` reads fixture files from any `fixtures/` directory inside a registered app. You can pass multiple names in one command or run them separately.
- The new fixture uses PKs 6–17, which do not conflict with the base fixtures (PKs 1–5).
- One trip in the new fixture (`pk: 17`) has `"distance": null` to simulate an in-progress trip — it is excluded from all distance averages automatically.
- Run `loaddata trips_variety` only once on a given database. Running it a second time will fail with a primary key conflict. Use `python manage.py flush` if you need to start fresh.

---

### 3. Add search support to the API functions in `src/api/fleet.js`

The backend's `VehicleViewSet` and `DriverViewSet` already have `SearchFilter` configured. We just need the frontend to pass the `?search=` query parameter when the user types something.

```js
// src/api/fleet.js

export async function fetchVehicles(search = '') {
  const url = search
    ? `${BASE_URL}/vehicles/?search=${encodeURIComponent(search)}`
    : `${BASE_URL}/vehicles/`
  const response = await fetch(url)
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch vehicles')
  return response.json()
}

export async function fetchDrivers(search = '') {
  // same pattern — drivers search on name, license_number, email
}

export async function fetchStats() {
  const response = await fetch(`${BASE_URL}/stats/`)
  if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch stats')
  return response.json()
}
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `search = ''` gives the parameter a default so existing call sites that omit it continue to work.
- The ternary builds the URL conditionally — when `search` is an empty string (falsy), we fetch without a query string to avoid sending `?search=` to the server.
- `encodeURIComponent(search)` percent-encodes special characters. A search term like `"Ford Transit"` would otherwise produce a broken URL; encoded it becomes `Ford%20Transit`.
- `fetchStats` is a new plain fetch function for the stats endpoint — the same pattern as the others.

---

### 4. Update `useVehicles` and `useDrivers` to accept search

The hooks need to accept a search term, pass it to the API function, and tell React Query to cache each unique search result separately.

```js
// src/hooks/useVehicles.js

import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { fetchVehicles } from "../api/fleet";

export function useVehicles(search = "") {
  const {
    data: vehicles = [],
    isLoading,
    isError,
    error,
  } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["vehicles", search],
    queryFn: () => fetchVehicles(search),
  });

  return { vehicles, isLoading, isError, error };
}

```

`useDrivers` follows the exact same pattern — swap `vehicles` for `drivers` and `fetchVehicles` for `fetchDrivers`.

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `queryKey: ['vehicles', search]` includes the search term so React Query caches `['vehicles', 'ford']` and `['vehicles', 'toyota']` as separate entries. Switching between two terms that were already fetched returns the cached result instantly.
- `queryFn: () => fetchVehicles(search)` uses an arrow function so the current value of `search` is captured in the closure at call time, rather than being evaluated when the hook mounts.

---

### 5. Add search inputs and `useEffect` to `src/pages/VehiclesAndDriversPage.jsx`

The search term state lives in the page.

```jsx
// src/pages/VehiclesAndDriversPage.jsx

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
// ... other imports ...

function VehiclesAndDriversPage() {
  const [vehicleSearch, setVehicleSearch] = useState("");
  const [driverSearch, setDriverSearch] = useState("");

  const { vehicles, isLoading: loadingVehicles } = useVehicles(vehicleSearch);
  const { drivers, isLoading: loadingDrivers } = useDrivers(driverSearch);
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-8">
      <section>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Vehicles</h2>
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Search by make, model, or plate..."
          value={vehicleSearch}
          onChange={(e) => setVehicleSearch(e.target.value)}
          className="input input-bordered w-full max-w-sm mb-3"
        />
        {loadingVehicles
          ? <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-md" />
          : <VehicleList vehicles={vehicles} />
        }
      </section>
      {/* same pattern for Drivers section */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- Each section has its own independent `useState` — `vehicleSearch` and `driverSearch` — so typing in one input does not affect the other.
- `value={vehicleSearch}` and `onChange={setVehicleSearch}` make the input controlled. React is the single source of truth for its value.
- The DRF `SearchFilter` performs a case-insensitive `icontains` across `make`, `model`, and `license_plate` — typing `"ford"` matches `"Ford Transit"` without needing exact casing.

---

### 6. Create `useStats` and the `StatCard` component

Before building the Trips page dashboard, we need the hook that fetches stats and a reusable card component to display individual values.

#### 6a. Create `src/hooks/useStats.js`

```js
// src/hooks/useStats.js

import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { fetchStats } from '../api/fleet'

export function useStats() {
  const { data: stats, isLoading, isError, error } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['stats'],
    queryFn: fetchStats,
  })
  return { stats, isLoading, isError, error }
}
```

#### 6b. Create `src/components/StatCard.jsx`

```jsx
// src/components/StatCard.jsx

function StatCard({ label, value, color }) {
  return (
    <div className={`card shadow-md ${color}`}>
      <div className="card-body">
        <p className="text-sm font-medium opacity-80">{label}</p>
        <p className="text-4xl font-bold">
          {value ?? <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-sm" />}
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default StatCard
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `useStats` follows the same `useQuery` pattern as the other hooks. The `queryKey: ['stats']` is stable — there is no search parameter — so stats are fetched once and cached until invalidated.
- `StatCard` receives `color` as a prop (e.g. `"bg-primary text-primary-content"`) so it can be reused for cards of different DaisyUI theme colours without needing separate components.
- `value ?? <span className="loading..." />` — the `??` (nullish coalescing) operator renders the spinner only when `value` is `null` or `undefined`. A value of `0` would render correctly as the number `0`, not a spinner.

---

### 7. Add stat cards and the chart to `src/pages/TripsPage.jsx`

The Trips page now has a dashboard section at the top with four stat cards and a bar chart, all driven by the single `useStats` call.

```jsx
// src/pages/TripsPage.jsx

import StatCard from '../components/StatCard'
import AverageDistanceChart from '../components/AverageDistanceChart'
import { useStats } from '../hooks/useStats'
// ... other imports ...

const STAT_CARDS = [
  { key: 'total_vehicles',    label: 'Total Vehicles',        color: 'bg-primary text-primary-content' },
  { key: 'total_drivers',     label: 'Total Drivers',         color: 'bg-secondary text-secondary-content' },
  { key: 'total_trips',       label: 'Total Trips',           color: 'bg-accent text-accent-content' },
  { key: 'avg_trip_distance', label: 'Average Trip Distance', color: 'bg-neutral text-neutral-content' },
]

function TripsPage() {
  const { trips, isLoading } = useTrips()
  const { stats } = useStats()

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-6">
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
        {STAT_CARDS.map(({ key, label, color }) => (
          <StatCard key={key} label={label} value={stats?.[key]} color={color} />
        ))}
      </div>

      {stats?.avg_distance_per_week?.length > 0 && (
        <AverageDistanceChart data={stats.avg_distance_per_week} />
      )}

      <div>
        <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-3">Trips</h2>
        {isLoading
          ? <span className="loading loading-spinner loading-md" />
          : <TripList trips={trips} />
        }
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `STAT_CARDS` is a configuration array defined outside the component. Each object holds the API key, the display label, and the DaisyUI colour string. Mapping over it keeps the JSX concise and makes adding a new card a one-line change.
- `stats?.[key]` uses optional chaining to safely access a property when `stats` is still `undefined` (loading). This passes `undefined` to `StatCard`, which renders the spinner via `??`.
- `stats?.avg_distance_per_week?.length > 0` guards the chart — it renders only once the data has arrived and contains at least one entry.
- `useStats` is called once in `TripsPage`. Both the stat cards and the chart read from the same cached query, so there is only one network request to `/api/v1/stats/`.

---

### 8. Create `src/components/AverageDistanceChart.jsx`

The chart component receives the weekly data array as a prop and renders a Recharts `BarChart` inside a DaisyUI card.

```jsx
// src/components/AverageDistanceChart.jsx

import {
  BarChart, Bar, XAxis, YAxis, CartesianGrid, Tooltip, ResponsiveContainer,
} from 'recharts'

function formatWeek(isoDate) {
  const date = new Date(isoDate)
  return date.toLocaleDateString('en-CA', { month: 'short', day: '2-digit' })
}

function AverageDistanceChart({ data }) {
  const chartData = data.map((entry) => ({
    week: formatWeek(entry.week),
    avg_distance: entry.avg_distance,
  }))

  return (
    <div className="card bg-base-100 shadow-md">
      <div className="card-body">
        <h3 className="card-title text-base">Average Trip Distance per Week</h3>
        <ResponsiveContainer width="100%" height={300}>
          <BarChart data={chartData} margin={{ top: 5, right: 16, left: 0, bottom: 5 }}>
            <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
            <XAxis dataKey="week" tick={{ fontSize: 12 }} />
            <YAxis unit=" km" width={70} tick={{ fontSize: 12 }} />
            <Tooltip formatter={(value) => [`${value} km`, 'Avg Distance']} />
            <Bar dataKey="avg_distance" fill="#570df8" radius={[4, 4, 0, 0]} />
          </BarChart>
        </ResponsiveContainer>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default AverageDistanceChart
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `formatWeek` converts the ISO date string from the API (e.g. `"2026-01-05"`) into a short human-readable label (e.g. `"Jan 05"`) for the X-axis ticks.
- `ResponsiveContainer width="100%"` makes the chart fill its parent's full width at all screen sizes. `height={300}` sets a fixed pixel height.
- `XAxis dataKey="week"` and `YAxis unit=" km"` configure the axis labels. `width={70}` on the Y-axis prevents the `km` unit from being clipped.
- `Tooltip formatter` customises the tooltip popup so it reads `"45.20 km — Avg Distance"` rather than showing the raw key name.
- `radius={[4, 4, 0, 0]}` rounds only the top corners of each bar — a common styling convention.
- The component knows nothing about the API — it only knows about the `data` prop. If the shape of the backend response changes, only `TripsPage` (the consumer) needs updating.

---

## Extension - Time permitting / If you want to go the extra mile

Every call to an external geocoding API costs time (and on paid tiers, money). Rather than hitting the API on every request, we store the coordinates on the `Trip` row the first time they are resolved and return the cached values on all subsequent requests.

#### 9a. Add coordinate fields to `fleet/models.py`

```python
# fleet/models.py

class Trip(models.Model):
    # ... existing fields ...
    start_lat = models.DecimalField(max_digits=9, decimal_places=6, null=True, blank=True)
    start_lng = models.DecimalField(max_digits=9, decimal_places=6, null=True, blank=True)
    end_lat = models.DecimalField(max_digits=9, decimal_places=6, null=True, blank=True)
    end_lng = models.DecimalField(max_digits=9, decimal_places=6, null=True, blank=True)
```

`null=True, blank=True` means the fields are optional — existing trips have no coordinates yet, and the `map` action will populate them on first use.

#### 9b. Create and apply the migration

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This applies the migration in `fleet/migrations/0002_trip_coordinates.py`, which adds the four new columns to the `fleet_trip` table.

#### 9c. Add the coordinate fields to `TripSerializer` in `fleet/serializers.py`

Add the four new field names to the `fields` list so the serializer exposes them:

```python
fields = [
    "id",
    "vehicle", "vehicle_detail",
    "driver", "driver_detail",
    "start_location", "end_location",
    "start_time", "end_time",
    "distance",
    "start_lat", "start_lng",
    "end_lat", "end_lng",
]
```

#### 9d. Install `geopy` and add the `map` action to `TripViewSet` in `fleet/views.py`

Install `geopy` in the backend virtual environment, add this new dependency to the `requirements.txt`, and then implement the `map` action as described in the code snippet below.

```bash
pip install geopy
```

Then update `views.py`:

```python
# fleet/views.py

import time
from geopy.distance import geodesic
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim
from rest_framework.decorators import action

class TripViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    # ... existing code ...

    @action(detail=True, methods=["get"])
    def map(self, request, pk=None):
        trip = self.get_object()
        needs_save = False
        geocoded_start = False
        geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="vehiclefleet-app")

        if trip.start_lat is None or trip.start_lng is None:
            result = geolocator.geocode(trip.start_location)
            if result:
                trip.start_lat = result.latitude
                trip.start_lng = result.longitude
                needs_save = True
            geocoded_start = True

        if trip.end_lat is None or trip.end_lng is None:
            if geocoded_start:
                time.sleep(1)  # Nominatim rate limit: max 1 request/second
            result = geolocator.geocode(trip.end_location)
            if result:
                trip.end_lat = result.latitude
                trip.end_lng = result.longitude
                needs_save = True

        if needs_save:
            start = (float(trip.start_lat), float(trip.start_lng))
            end = (float(trip.end_lat), float(trip.end_lng))
            trip.distance = round(geodesic(start, end).km, 2)
            trip.save(update_fields=["start_lat", "start_lng", "end_lat", "end_lng", "distance"])

        serializer = self.get_serializer(trip)

        return Response({
            **serializer.data,
            "start_coordinates": {
                "lat": float(trip.start_lat),
                "lng": float(trip.start_lng),
            } if trip.start_lat is not None else None,
            "end_coordinates": {
                "lat": float(trip.end_lat),
                "lng": float(trip.end_lng),
            } if trip.end_lat is not None else None,
        })
```

The new endpoint is available at `GET /api/v1/trips/{id}/map/`.

Example response (first call geocodes, calculates distance, and saves; subsequent calls return the stored values):

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "vehicle_detail": { "..." : "..." },
  "driver_detail": { "..." : "..." },
  "start_location": "Calgary, AB",
  "end_location": "Edmonton, AB",
  "start_time": "2026-01-10T08:00:00Z",
  "end_time": "2026-01-10T11:00:00Z",
  "distance": "299.71",
  "start_lat": "51.044734",
  "start_lng": "-114.071883",
  "end_lat": "53.546124",
  "end_lng": "-113.493823",
  "start_coordinates": { "lat": 51.044734, "lng": -114.071883 },
  "end_coordinates": { "lat": 53.546124, "lng": -113.493823 }
}
```

Let's talk about what this code is doing.
- `@action(detail=True, methods=["get"])` registers the method as a detail route — DRF appends the method name to the URL, giving us `/trips/{id}/map/`. `detail=True` means the route includes a `pk` so we can look up the specific trip.
- `self.get_object()` fetches the trip by `pk` and applies any permission checks automatically — the same way the standard `retrieve` action works.
- The `if trip.start_lat is None` guard is the cache check: if the coordinates are already stored in the database we skip the geocoding call entirely. On the first request for a given trip the fields are `null`, so the API is called; every subsequent request reads from the database.
- `Nominatim` is geopy's wrapper around the free OpenStreetMap geocoding service. The `user_agent` string is required by Nominatim's terms of service to identify the calling application.
- `geolocator.geocode(trip.start_location)` sends the location string (e.g. `"Calgary, AB"`) to Nominatim and returns a `Location` object with `.latitude` and `.longitude` attributes, or `None` if the address cannot be resolved.
- `time.sleep(1)` is placed between the two geocode calls only when both are actually made. Nominatim enforces a rate limit of one request per second; skipping the sleep when making back-to-back calls will result in HTTP 429 errors.
- `geodesic(start, end).km` uses geopy's geodesic formula to calculate the real-world distance between the two lat/lng pairs in kilometres. Unlike a simple straight-line formula, geodesic accounts for the curvature of the Earth, giving a much more accurate result.
- `trip.save(update_fields=[...])` writes only the coordinate and distance columns rather than updating the entire row. `"distance"` is included so the geodesic result is persisted alongside the coordinates — subsequent calls to `/map/` will return the stored distance without recalculating.
- `float(trip.start_lat)` converts the `Decimal` database value to a plain Python float for the JSON response. The raw `Decimal` is also exposed via `serializer.data` (as a string), which is useful for frontend code that needs full precision.
- `**serializer.data` spreads all the existing trip fields into the response dict so the caller receives both the full trip object and the coordinates in a single request.


Notes on this:
- We'll be using the lat long in the next class to show how to display a map on the frontend, so we want to make sure that the data is cached properly.
- We'll also be talking about a better way to organize this code in the future in a `services.py` file but for now this is okay for demonstration purposes. The main point is to show how to cache the geocoding results on the model and only call the external API when necessary.
- There's different architectural choices about when to geocode the address as well but we'll discuss this in future classes. There are a lot of choices here:
    - using a signal to geocode on save if not populated
    - a periodic background task that geocodes any uncached addresses
    - override the save method on the model to geocode when saving a new trip

---

## Challenge/Exercise

### 1. Add a total trips per week chart

The stats endpoint currently returns average distances but not trip counts per week.
- Add a `trips_per_week` key to `FleetStatsView` that counts trips grouped by `TruncWeek` over the same 6-month window.
- Create a new `TripsPerWeekChart` component using Recharts `LineChart` instead of `BarChart`.
- Add it to `TripsPage` below the `AverageDistanceChart`.

### 2. Debounce the search inputs

Currently every keystroke fires an API request. For a production app you would debounce the input so requests only fire after the user stops typing.
- Add `useState` for a `debouncedVehicleSearch` value that updates 300ms after `vehicleSearch` changes using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` inside a `useEffect`.
- Pass `debouncedVehicleSearch` to `useVehicles` instead of the raw `vehicleSearch` so the hook only fetches when the debounced value changes.
- Apply the same pattern to the drivers search.

---

## Conclusion

In this example we learned about:
- **`Avg` and `TruncWeek` aggregations** — Django's ORM can compute averages and group by truncated time periods (`TruncWeek`, `TruncMonth`) in a single SQL query
- **Rolling time windows** — `timezone.now() - timedelta(weeks=26)` creates a dynamic window; always use `timezone.now()` (not `datetime.now()`) when `USE_TZ = True`
- **Dynamic `queryKey` for per-search caching** — including the search term in `queryKey: ['vehicles', search]` gives each unique search its own cache entry; re-visiting a previous search returns the cached result instantly
- **`encodeURIComponent`** — always encode user-supplied strings before embedding them in a URL to handle spaces and special characters safely
- **Config arrays for repeated components** — defining card data as `STAT_CARDS = [{ key, label, color }]` outside the component body keeps the JSX concise and makes adding or reordering cards a one-line change
- **`value ?? fallback`** — nullish coalescing (`??`) renders a fallback only for `null`/`undefined`, not for falsy values like `0`; use it in display components to show loading state without hiding valid zero values
- **`ResponsiveContainer`** — Recharts charts need `ResponsiveContainer` to fill their parent's width; without it the chart has a fixed pixel width that breaks on smaller screens
- **Single fetch, multiple consumers** — calling `useStats` once in `TripsPage` means the stat cards and the chart share a single cached network request
- **`geodesic` vs straight-line distance** — geopy's `geodesic(start, end).km` accounts for Earth's curvature, giving a real-world distance rather than a flat-plane approximation; it replaces any previously stored placeholder distance with an accurate value derived from the actual coordinates
- **Caution — `loaddata` cannot be run twice on the same database** without flushing first; the new `trips_variety` fixture uses explicit PKs that will conflict on a second run
- **Caution — in-progress trips are silently excluded from `Avg`** — Django's `Avg` ignores `null` values, so any trip without a recorded `distance` does not affect the averages; this is usually the desired behaviour but can be surprising if you expect all trips to contribute
